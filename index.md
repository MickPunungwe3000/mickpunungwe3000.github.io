Welcome to My Digital Forge

I'm Maverik Punungwe , a seasoned Java and Spring engineer, system architect, and full-stack builder of real-world software. Not the kind of stuff that just looks good in a portfolio: The kind that actually runs in the wild, makes money, and solves real problems.

I’ve spent the last 7 years kneedeep in code & writing production systems, shipping working software, debugging messes at 2.47AM, and scaling infrastructure for companies that can’t afford to crash. If you’ve driven past a digital billboard anywhere in South Africa, odds are the system running the content came from something I built. I helped develop the backbone for the market leader in LED displays.

My roots are in Electronic Engineering, where I got hooked on circuits and code. That love for building evolved into a career so now I work with Java(11+), Spring Boot, C#, C, and modern stacks to build systems that last. I’ve worked with queues, protocols, APIs, embedded devices, and IoT gear. I still design circuits on the side , it’s in the blood.

This site is my personal base of operations. It’s where I teach my past self;the one who was hungry, clueless, and trying to figure it all out. No fluff here. No tutorials-for-the-sake-of-tutorials. Just lessons learned the hard way: how to identify if you are actually applying clean code (thanx uncle Bob),SOLID principles (again thanx uncle Bob), architecture, Java mastery (or at least the pursuit of it), and battle tested advice for devs who want to level up faster.

I welcome you to this journey.
