I'm **Maverik Punungwe**, a seasoned software engineer and systems architect based in South Africa, originally from Zimbabwe.

For the past 7 years, I’ve been writing production-grade software , not demo apps or tutorials, but **real systems** that businesses depend on. My primary weapon of choice is **Java + Spring Boot**, but I’ve also built with **C#, C, Dart**, and multiple front-end stacks.

I started out in **Electronic Engineering**, which gave me a solid grasp of circuits, embedded systems, and the low-level world, and that mindset still shapes how I write code: clean, efficient, resilient.

# 🛠 What I Do

- **Java Backend Development**  REST APIs, microservices, queue-based systems  
- **Spring Boot Architecture**  modular, scalable, production-ready systems  
- **Embedded Software + IoT**  sensor networks, custom hardware integration  
- **Full-Stack Dev**  Java specialist
- **Digital Signage Systems**  Built the backend for the **market leader in LED billboards** across Southern Africa

If you’ve seen a digital billboard in South Africa… chances are, my system is running behind it. I designed and shipped the core infrastructure for the dominant signage company , from player software to scheduling, streaming, and update protocols.

# 🧠 What Drives Me

I believe in building things that **actually work**. That survive pressure. That deliver value without crumbling under load.

I’m obsessed with:
- **Clean Code**  because maintenance is everything  
- **System Design**  because scale always comes faster than expected  
- **Teaching by writing**  because the best way to master something is to explain it  

This blog is me passing the torch backward, sharing the tools, principles, and mindset shifts that helped me avoid years of detours.

# 📚 Outside of Code

- I read everything from **MJ DeMarco** to **Robert Kiyosaki**  
- I design circuits and IoT prototypes for fun  
- I lift weights, write comic scripts, and kick around a soccer ball  
- I’ve solo traveled to **Zanzibar**, **Kenya**, and **Mozambique**
