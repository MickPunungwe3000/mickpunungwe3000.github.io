I'm **Maverik Punungwe**, a seasoned software engineer and systems architect based in South Africa, originally from Zimbabwe.

For the past 7 years, I’ve been writing production-grade software — not demo apps or tutorials, but **real systems** that businesses depend on. My primary weapon of choice is **Java + Spring Boot**, but I’ve also built with **C#, C, Dart**, and multiple front-end stacks.

I started out in **Electronic Engineering**, which gave me a solid grasp of circuits, embedded systems, and the low-level world — and that mindset still shapes how I write code: clean, efficient, resilient.

# 🛠 What I Do

- **Java Backend Development** — REST APIs, microservices, queue-based systems  
- **Spring Boot Architecture** — modular, scalable, production-ready systems  
- **Embedded Software + IoT** — sensor networks, custom hardware integration  
- **Full-Stack Dev** — Kotlin/Dart/Flutter, JS, and frontend glue when needed  
- **Digital Signage Systems** — Built the backend for the **market leader in LED billboards** across Southern Africa

If you’ve seen a digital billboard in South Africa… chances are, my system is running behind it. I designed and shipped the core infrastructure for the dominant signage company — from player software to scheduling, streaming, and update protocols.

# 🧠 What Drives Me

I believe in building things that **actually work**. That survive pressure. That deliver value without crumbling under load.

I’m obsessed with:
- **Clean Code** — because maintenance is everything  
- **System Design** — because scale always comes faster than expected  
- **Teaching by writing** — because the best way to master something is to explain it  

This blog is me passing the torch backward — sharing the tools, principles, and mindset shifts that helped me avoid years of detours.

# 📚 Outside of Code

- I read everything from **MJ DeMarco** to **Robert Kiyosaki**  
- I design circuits and IoT prototypes for fun  
- I lift weights, write comic scripts, and kick around a soccer ball  
- I’ve solo traveled to **Zanzibar**, **Kenya**, and **Mozambique**
