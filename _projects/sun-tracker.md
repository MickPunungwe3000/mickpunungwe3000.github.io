##  Sun-Tracking Solar System

This project maximizes solar panel efficiency by automatically rotating the panel to face the sun throughout the day using real-time light sensing and servo actuation.

---

### ðŸ”§ Tech Stack

- **Microcontroller**: STM32 (ARM Cortex-M series)
- **Sensors**: Light-sensing diodes (LDRs)
- **Control**: Direction-switching IC (exact chip name TBD)
- **Actuation**: Servo motors
- **Firmware**: Bare-metal C

---

###  What It Does

The system detects sunlight intensity from multiple angles using light-sensing diodes. Based on this input, it determines where the sun is and rotates the panel toward it using dual-axis motion.

The goal: **maximize solar energy capture without using GPS or time-based algorithms.**

---

###  Highlights

- **Dual-axis tracking** for full daylight coverage
- **Real-time analog feedback** from LDRs
- **Efficient energy usage**: Only moves when the sunâ€™s position changes significantly
- **Improved yield**: Up to 30% more solar energy compared to fixed panels
- **Low-cost components**, designed with scalability in mind for rural deployment

###  What I Learned

- Fine-tuning analog signal thresholds in harsh sunlight
- Using PWM with STM32 timers for motor control
- Balancing responsiveness with power efficiency
- Debugging servo jitter and feedback noise
