In the journey to becoming a senior software engineer, one concept separates good developers from great ones: **Clean Code**.

Writing clean code isn't just about making it look pretty. It's about writing code that's easy to read, easy to change, and hard to break.

### 🧠 Why it matters:
- Your code becomes self-documenting
- Debugging and extending features is easier
- Your team (or future you) will thank you

### 🔑 Key Clean Code Principles
- Use meaningful names
- Keep methods short and focused
- Eliminate duplication
- Favor clarity over cleverness
