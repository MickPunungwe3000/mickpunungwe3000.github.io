SOLID principles are foundational to maintainable, scalable software design.

### ✅ S: Single Responsibility Principle
Each class should have one reason to change.

### ✅ O: Open/Closed Principle
Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

### ✅ L: Liskov Substitution Principle
Subtypes must be substitutable for base types.

### ✅ I: Interface Segregation Principle
Prefer small, specific interfaces.

### ✅ D: Dependency Inversion Principle
Depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations.
