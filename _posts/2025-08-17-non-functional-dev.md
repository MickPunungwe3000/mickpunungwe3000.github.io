## Non-functional Development = The Real Glue

Early in my career, ‚Äúgood development‚Äù meant **writing clean code** and **making features work.**  
That‚Äôs where most of us start, and honestly it‚Äôs not wrong. You need to learn how to build working features before anything else.  

But as I grew and began working on services used by millions, I quickly realised that real difference between software that just *functions* and software that truly **thrives in production** comes from something deeper: **non-functional development.**  

Once I started factoring that in, **architecture and planning became more intentional, and the systems we delivered felt engineered, not just coded.**

---

### 1. **Performance**
- Caching with Spring Cache / Redis  
- Async processing with `@Async`  
- Database indexing and query tuning  

---

### 2. **Scalability**
- Stateless services that can scale horizontally  
- Spring Cloud for distributed systems  
- Containerization (Docker/Kubernetes)  

---

### 3. **Security**
- Spring Security for authentication & authorization  
- Encrypt sensitive data (Jasypt, Vault)  
- OWASP practices baked in  

---

### 4. **Reliability**
- Circuit breakers & retries with Resilience4j  
- Graceful error handling with `@ControllerAdvice`  
- Health checks with Spring Boot Actuator  

---

### 5. **Maintainability**
- Clear separation of concerns (Controllers, Services, Repos)  
- Consistent logging with SLF4J + Logback  
- CI/CD pipelines to prevent ‚Äúworks on my machine‚Äù moments  

---

### 6. **Observability**
- Metrics & monitoring via Micrometer + Prometheus  
- Centralized logging (ELK, Loki, etc.)  
- Distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry  

---

### 7. **Usability**
- Consistent REST conventions  
- API documentation with SpringDoc / Swagger  
- Error messages humans can actually read

**Golden Rule:**  
Features make your app *useful*.  
Non-functional development makes your app *usable at scale*.  

Both matter.  
But if you skip the non-functional side, you‚Äôll always be firefighting instead of building.
