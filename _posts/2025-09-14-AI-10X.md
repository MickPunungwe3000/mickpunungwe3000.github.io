# How I am using AI Responsibly to chase 10x Engineering

I always thought the “10x engineer” was a legend, the kind of status nobody really achieves. I still think it’s more myth than reality, but with the tools we have today, it feels less out of reach. Not because of shortcuts or hacks, but because AI, when used responsibly, removes friction and frees me to focus on higher-value work.  

The key is discipline and self-awareness. AI isn’t a replacement for skill or judgment. It’s a helper that only works if you stay critical and own the final decisions.  

---

## 1. Design partner, not architect  
AI helps me test assumptions and surface blind spots. I’ll ask for pitfalls or trade-offs in a design, but I never let it dictate architecture. The responsibility for choices, patterns, and compromises is still mine.  

---

## 2. Boilerplate, not business logic  
I use AI to spin up repetitive code like DTOs or repository stubs. Then I refine, rename, simplify, and test. It gives me scaffolding. The craftsmanship still comes from me.  

---

## 3. Debugging aid, not fixer  
When errors or legacy code get messy, I lean on AI to explain. But I validate every suggestion against documentation and make sure I understand why it works before I accept it.  

---

## 4. Learning accelerator, not replacement  
AI helps me stay current by summarizing changes or comparing approaches. But real understanding only comes when I dig into official sources and work through the details myself.  

---

## My rules for responsible AI use  
- I am the senior engineer. AI is the junior. I decide.  
- Never share confidential code.  
- Verify everything against trusted sources.  
- If I don’t understand it, I don’t ship it.  

---

## Bottom line  
AI won’t make anyone a 10x engineer on its own. Used wisely, though, it clears away noise and gives space to focus on design, clarity, and impact.  

The legendary 10x engineer may always be a stretch, but with responsible AI use, we can at least move closer.
