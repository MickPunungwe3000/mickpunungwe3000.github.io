## Good API = Predictable, Stable, and Boring
  
Hereâ€™s the checklist:

---

### 1. **Clear Purpose**
Every endpoint should have one job.  
`/users` gets users.  
`/users/{id}` gets a specific user.  
NOT `/getEverythingAndAlsoMaybeDelete`.

---

### 2. **Consistent Naming**
If you use `/users` for list, donâ€™t suddenly use `/getAllAccounts`.  
Consistency means devs donâ€™t have to re-learn the rules for every endpoint.

`GET /users`  
`GET /users/{id}`  
`POST /users`  
NOT `GET /find-user-by-id`

---

### 3. **HTTP Methods Done Right**
- **GET** = Fetch data  
- **POST** = Create  
- **PUT/PATCH** = Update  
- **DELETE** = Remove  
Donâ€™t be that API that deletes data with a GET request.

---

### 4. **Good Responses**
Return the right HTTP status codes:  
- 200 OK = Success  
- 201 Created = New resource made  
- 400 Bad Request = Client messed up  
- 404 Not Found = Resource doesnâ€™t exist  
- 500 Internal Server Error = You messed up  

And always return JSON with a predictable shape.

---

### 5. **Versioning**
Breaking changes happen. Be honest about it.  
`/api/v1/users` â†’ `/api/v2/users`  
Donâ€™t quietly change behavior and hope nobody notices.

---

### 6. **Validation**
Donâ€™t trust the client. Validate *everything*.  
Bad data should die at the door, not sneak into your DB.

---

### 7. **Documentation**
If someone needs to email you to understand your API, you failed.  
Use OpenAPI/Swagger. Keep it updated.

---

**Golden Rule:**  
A good API feels like muscle memory.  
You shouldnâ€™t need to keep the docs open once youâ€™ve used it a few times.  

Boring APIs are the best APIs. They last. They scale. They donâ€™t surprise you.
