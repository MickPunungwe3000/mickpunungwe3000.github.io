# Starting a New Chapter as a Senior Developer & Reflections

It’s been a while since I last wrote anything for my blog and for good reason.  
The final stretch of the year is always intense for devs. Deadlines pile up, systems need hardening, and priorities shift fast.  

But amid the chaos came good news: **I’m happy to share that I’ve officially stepped into the role of Senior Developer at Dariel.**  
It’s been a journey full of lessons, refactors, and late-night debugging , but also of growth, gratitude, and perspective.

## The Growth in the Uncomfortable

A new chapter like this always brings a familiar mix of excitement and quiet responsibility.  
I’ve learned to see that tension not as fear, but as a sign of growth. It is proof that one cares deeply about doing the job well and are ready to stretch into something bigger.  

Growth never feels comfortable. It’s supposed to challenge the parts of you that have settled.

## Career Progression

My people have a saying: *“Kure kwegava ndiko kusina mutsvubvu.”* If you asked my grandmother for a direct translation, she’d probably talk about a, “determined jackal on a snack mission” which always makes me chuckle.

But the true spirit of the proverb runs deeper: **“No distance is too far where there is motivation.”**  
That’s what sticks with me. It’s not about chasing a destination like “Senior” or “Staff,” but about the intent behind the journey itself.  

In our world, growth isn’t a sprint , it’s the deliberate work of mastering where you are. The challenges almost feel like a curriculum for seniority.  

So while there’s no rush toward the next title, my focus is clear: to live this Senior level fully , to understand it, lead from within it, and turn it into a true craft.

## Mentorship, Multiplied Impact, and Raising the Floor

As I move into this new chapter, I’ve been reflecting on how much of our growth depends on the people around us.  

Good mentorship doesn’t always come through formal one-on-ones. Sometimes it’s a senior asking, *“Why this approach?”* instead of *“Change this.”*  
That small shift grows developers faster than any tutorial ever could.  

At the senior level, your role expands beyond code.  
It’s about **raising the floor**, sharing what you know, designing with clarity, and asking the kind of questions that make others think deeper.  
It’s about creating an environment where learning is safe, feedback is normal, and growth is shared.

## My Simple Rule Going Forward

> “Teach what you learn as soon as you learn it.”

It’s simple, but powerful.  
Every lesson you capture and every insight you share strengthens both the team and the craft.  

That’s something I want to lean into more deliberately in this next phase , documenting, mentoring, and learning in public.  
It’s also why I write: to come back, reflect, and keep evolving.

## Closing Thoughts

This feels less like a finish line and more like a new beginning. I’m deeply grateful for the mentors, teammates, and environment that helped shape this journey so far.  

Here’s to showing up, learning openly, and growing through the uncomfortable parts.  
That’s where the real progress happens.
